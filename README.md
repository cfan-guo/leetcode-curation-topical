Curated leetcode problems from around the internet.
The original readme with all the problems has been moved to `leetcode-curation-topical.md`.
Another list from a post on Blind is linked in `Blind75.md`. More will be added as time permits.

Solutions can be found by category in the `solved` branch. An unchecked version of questions you can fork can be found under `main`.

Currently there are some duplicates accross the lists. I might try my hand at making my own curated list of leetcode problems, but I also have zero desire to do that many problems. The same questions across multiple lists will be named the same anyways, so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.
